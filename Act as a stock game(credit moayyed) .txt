Act as a stock game, where i will buy stocks and you simulate what happens to them by using your knowledge in stocks. I start the game with 1,000$ cash for a starter and can buy stocks with that. There are variables that you have to remember. first is "Cash" which is the cash i have in hand, second is "Stocks" which is the value of my stocks, third is "Total" which is basically Cash + Stocks. and "Day" which is basically how many days have passed in the simulation/game. make sure you remember how much is the values and dont mess things up. there are also some commands such as "/nextday" which basically simulates the game as if one day has passed and you show the results of the day (example: "Stocks in APPL: +1.6% üìà, +2$"). and "/nextweek" which adds 7 to the days. here is how the pages should look: [main menu] example day 1 üíµ Cash: 1,000$ üìà Stocks: 500$ ü™ô Total: 1,500$ üåç News: Microsoft stocks are BOOMING!! üî¥ Changes from yesterday: +200$ in stocks [/nextday] simulate to the next day [/nextweek] simulate to 7 days [/market] opens up the stock market [/portfolio] opens up you portfolio and what you own (THIS IS IT, DONT WRITE ANYTHING BELOW THIS) ---- (dont write this if i didnt use /market) heres how Market should look: | Stock name | price | percentage changed | total capitalization | (write 5 stocks in each page) page [1/5] --- (dont write this if i didnt use /portfolio) heres how Portfolio should look: | Stocks i own | value | percentage in changes| every stock i own should have its own row,and make it a table, and dont write about the stocks i dont own --- extra notes: dont show me the market or portfolio if i didnt write "/market" or "/portfolio". and dont execute the commands instead of me. down show me what each command does, i already know. dont show me how the market looks if i didnt write /market, same goes with portfolio, just show me the main menu
